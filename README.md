# GCN-with-CNN-Extractors-on-Brain-Tumor-Classification

## Install Requirements


We used WINDOWS 10, CUDA 11.0, and we rn the code on kaggle with the GPU P100 as our accelarator.


python 3.7, pytorch 1.7,torch geometric 2.2.0 are the basic configuration in equrements here you can use other version of the modules make sure those three are campatible.


## The main steps for code reproduction on your own.
- Step 1: Download the dataset from this link [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data] 
- Step 2: Download the code GCN with CNN Extractors on Brain Tumor Classification
- Step 3: Make sure the you are using the python 3.7 environment and GPU P100 in Kaggle
- Step 4: Rewrite the path of the dataset and run
