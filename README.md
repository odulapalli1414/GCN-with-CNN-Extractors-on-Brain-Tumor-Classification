# GCN-with-CNN-Extractors-on-Brain-Tumor-Classification

## Install Requirements


With the GPU P100 serving as our accelerator, the code on Kaggle using CUDA 11.0 and Windows 10.
The baseline configuration in these requirements is Python 3.7, PyTorch 1.7, and Torch Geometric 2.2.0. You can use other versions of the modules, but make sure those three are compatible.

## The main steps for code reproduction on your own.
- Step 1: Download the dataset from this link [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri/data] 
- Step 2: Download the code GCN with CNN Extractors on Brain Tumor Classification
- Step 3: Make sure the you are using the python 3.7 environment and GPU P100 in Kaggle
- Step 4: Rewrite the path of the dataset and run
